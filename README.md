# finye

Trading options is a fantastic way to define your portfolio’s risk and maximize its risk vs reward ratio. Thinkorswim, tastytrade, and Dough are three platforms which provide both education and tools for trading options. Their intellectual and graphical approach is extremely helpful and influenced this project.

The goal of Finye is to find the optimal underlyings to trade with covered calls, a fairly basic defined-risk options strategy. Finye enables you to find the maximum ‘bang for your buck’ by displaying the short call price vs the underlying price along with other helpful metrics.

With this project, I’ve utilized APIs, the principles of object-oriented programming, and Pandas and Python for data analysis. Currently, I’m aiming to (i) expand the project by creating a web-interface, (ii) store data online for extremely liquid underlyings to analyze implied volatility over time, and (iii) implement options-pricing models to calculate additional features.
